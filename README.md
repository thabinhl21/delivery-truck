# Delivery Truck Simulation

Each truck is given a map that contains the addresses of different post service offices and all of the possible places it might need to deliver the packages to. The truck starts out empty and goes to pick up all of the packages from all of the different offices, then delivers them to the correct address in the fastest route it can.
